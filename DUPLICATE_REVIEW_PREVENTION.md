# Duplicate Review Prevention Fix

## Problem Description

The review system was allowing users to submit multiple reviews for the same product. When a user tried to leave a review on a product they had already reviewed, the system would overwrite their existing review instead of preventing them from creating a duplicate.

## Root Cause

The `createProductReview` function in `/lib/db.ts` was designed to allow users to update their existing reviews. When a user submitted a review for a product they had already reviewed, the system would:

1. Check if a review exists
2. If it exists, update the existing review instead of preventing submission
3. This created confusion as users expected to be prevented from creating duplicates

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Review Creation Logic (`/lib/db.ts`)

**Before**: Allow users to update existing reviews
```javascript
if (existingReview.rows.length === 0) {
  // Create new review
} else {
  // Update existing review
}
```

**After**: Prevent duplicate reviews entirely
```javascript
if (existingReview.rows.length > 0) {
  await query('ROLLBACK')
  throw new Error('You have already reviewed this product. You cannot submit another review.')
}
// Create new review only
```

### 2. Added Review Status Check API (`/app/api/products/[id]/reviews/check/route.ts`)

Created a new API endpoint to check if a user has already reviewed a product:

```javascript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const session = await auth()
  const existingReview = await hasUserReviewedProduct(session.user.id, params.id)
  
  return NextResponse.json({
    hasReviewed: !!existingReview,
    review: existingReview
  })
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Review Component (`/components/product-reviews.tsx`)

**Added user review status checking**:
- Automatically checks if user has already reviewed the product
- Shows different UI based on review status
- Displays existing review details if user has already reviewed

**Updated UI behavior**:
- If user hasn't reviewed: Shows "Write a Review" button
- If user has reviewed: Shows review details with status
- If user is writing review: Shows review form
- Loading state while checking review status

### 4. Added Database Helper Function (`/lib/db.ts`)

Created `hasUserReviewedProduct` function to check review status:

```javascript
export async function hasUserReviewedProduct(userId: string, productId: string) {
  const result = await query(`
    SELECT id, status, rating, title, content, created_at
    FROM product_reviews 
    WHERE user_id = $1 AND product_id = $2
  `, [userId, productId])
  
  return result.rows.length > 0 ? result.rows[0] : null
}
```

## How the Fix Works

### 1. Prevention at Database Level
- Database has `UNIQUE(product_id, user_id)` constraint
- Prevents duplicate reviews at the database level
- Provides additional safety beyond application logic

### 2. Prevention at Application Level
- `createProductReview` function checks for existing reviews
- Throws error if user has already reviewed the product
- Prevents the review submission entirely

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Users see their existing review details
- Clear messaging about review status
- No confusion about whether they can review again

### 4. API Response Handling
- Review form shows appropriate error messages
- Users understand why they can't submit another review
- Clear feedback about review status

## User Experience Flow

### For New Reviewers:
1. User visits product page
2. Sees "Write a Review" button
3. Clicks button to open review form
4. Submits review successfully
5. Review appears in "Your Review" section

### For Existing Reviewers:
1. User visits product page
2. Sees "Your Review" section with existing review details
3. Shows review rating, title, content, and status
4. No option to write another review
5. Clear indication that they've already reviewed

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `test-duplicate-reviews.js` that verifies:

1. **Database Constraints**: Checks for unique constraints on product_reviews table
2. **Existing Duplicates**: Identifies any existing duplicate reviews in the database
3. **Prevention Logic**: Tests the duplicate prevention mechanism
4. **Statistics**: Analyzes review distribution and uniqueness
5. **Status Distribution**: Shows review status breakdown

Run the test with:
```bash
node test-duplicate-reviews.js
```

## Expected Results

After this fix:

1. **Users cannot submit duplicate reviews**:
   - Clear error message when attempting to review same product twice
   - Database constraint prevents duplicates at the database level
   - Application logic prevents duplicates at the API level

2. **Better user experience**:
   - Users see their existing review details
   - Clear indication of review status (pending/approved/rejected)
   - No confusion about review submission

3. **Improved review management**:
   - One review per user per product
   - Consistent review data
   - Better review quality control

## Backward Compatibility

The fix is backward compatible:
- Existing reviews remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Database constraints already existed
- Only changes the behavior for new review submissions

## Future Considerations

1. **Review Editing**: If users want to edit their reviews, consider adding an edit feature
2. **Review Deletion**: Allow users to delete their reviews and submit new ones
3. **Review History**: Track review changes for audit purposes
4. **Admin Override**: Allow admins to delete reviews if needed

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents Review Spam**: Users cannot submit multiple reviews for the same product
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures one review per user per product
3. **Consistent Experience**: All users have the same review submission rules
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear tracking of who has reviewed what
