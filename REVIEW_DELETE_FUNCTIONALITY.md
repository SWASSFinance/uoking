# Review Delete Functionality

## Overview

Added the ability for administrators to delete reviews from the admin panel. This functionality allows admins to remove inappropriate, spam, or incorrect reviews from the system.

## Features Added

### 1. API Endpoint Enhancement (`/app/api/admin/reviews/[id]/route.ts`)

**Added DELETE method** to the existing review management API:

```javascript
export async function DELETE(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Admin authentication check
  // Get review details before deletion
  // Delete the review
  // Update user review counts if review was approved
  // Return success response
}
```

**Key Features**:
- **Admin Authentication**: Only admin users can delete reviews
- **Review Retrieval**: Gets review details before deletion for proper user count updates
- **User Count Management**: Decrements user review counts if the deleted review was approved
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### 2. Admin UI Enhancement (`/app/admin/reviews/page.tsx`)

**Added delete functionality to the admin interface**:

- **Delete Button**: Added a red "Delete" button for all reviews (pending, approved, rejected)
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows confirmation dialog before deletion
- **Visual Feedback**: Success/error toast notifications
- **Auto-refresh**: Automatically reloads the review list after deletion

**UI Changes**:
```javascript
// Added delete handler
const handleDeleteReview = async (reviewId: string) => {
  if (!confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this review? This action cannot be undone.')) {
    return
  }
  // Delete logic with error handling
}

// Added delete button to all reviews
<Button
  onClick={() => handleDeleteReview(review.id)}
  size="sm"
  variant="outline"
  className="border-red-200 text-red-600 hover:bg-red-50"
>
  <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Delete
</Button>
```

## How It Works

### 1. Delete Process Flow

1. **Admin clicks delete button** on any review
2. **Confirmation dialog** appears asking for confirmation
3. **DELETE request** sent to `/api/admin/reviews/[id]`
4. **Admin authentication** verified
5. **Review details retrieved** before deletion
6. **Review deleted** from database
7. **User counts updated** if review was approved
8. **Success response** returned
9. **UI updated** with refreshed review list

### 2. User Count Management

**When deleting an approved review**:
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET review_count = GREATEST(COALESCE(review_count, 0) - 1, 0),
    rating_count = GREATEST(COALESCE(rating_count, 0) - CASE WHEN $1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, 0)
WHERE id = $2
```

**When deleting a pending/rejected review**:
- User counts remain unchanged (since they weren't counted in the first place)

### 3. Security Features

- **Admin-only access**: Only users with `is_admin = true` can delete reviews
- **Authentication required**: Must be logged in to access delete functionality
- **Confirmation dialog**: Prevents accidental deletions
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing columns or database errors

## User Experience

### For Administrators:

1. **Review Management**: Can delete any review regardless of status
2. **Visual Feedback**: Clear success/error messages
3. **Confirmation**: Prevents accidental deletions
4. **Immediate Updates**: Review list refreshes after deletion

### For Users:

1. **Data Integrity**: User review counts are properly maintained
2. **No Impact**: Deleting a review doesn't affect other user data
3. **Consistency**: Review counts remain accurate

## Technical Implementation

### Database Operations

1. **Review Retrieval**:
   ```sql
   SELECT user_id, rating, status FROM product_reviews WHERE id = $1
   ```

2. **Review Deletion**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM product_reviews WHERE id = $1
   ```

3. **User Count Update** (if approved):
   ```sql
   UPDATE users 
   SET review_count = GREATEST(COALESCE(review_count, 0) - 1, 0),
       rating_count = GREATEST(COALESCE(rating_count, 0) - CASE WHEN $1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, 0)
   WHERE id = $2
   ```

### Error Handling

- **Review not found**: Returns 404 error
- **Admin access denied**: Returns 403 error
- **Authentication required**: Returns 401 error
- **Database errors**: Returns 500 error with logging
- **Missing columns**: Graceful degradation with warnings

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `test-review-delete.js` that verifies:

1. **Current Statistics**: Shows review counts and distribution
2. **User Counts**: Validates user review count accuracy
3. **Deletion Logic**: Simulates the deletion process
4. **Data Integrity**: Checks for orphaned records
5. **Constraints**: Verifies database constraints

Run the test with:
```bash
node test-review-delete.js
```

## Expected Results

After implementing this functionality:

1. **Admin Capabilities**:
   - Can delete any review (pending, approved, rejected)
   - Clear confirmation before deletion
   - Immediate feedback on success/failure

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - User review counts remain accurate
   - No orphaned records created
   - Database constraints maintained

3. **User Experience**:
   - No impact on user accounts
   - Review counts properly maintained
   - System remains consistent

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Only admin users can delete reviews
2. **Audit Trail**: Consider logging deletions for audit purposes
3. **Data Recovery**: Deletions are permanent - consider backup strategies
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Future Enhancements

1. **Soft Delete**: Instead of permanent deletion, mark reviews as "deleted"
2. **Audit Logging**: Log all deletion actions with admin details
3. **Bulk Operations**: Allow deleting multiple reviews at once
4. **Review History**: Track review changes and deletions
5. **Notification System**: Notify users when their reviews are deleted

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- No changes to existing review functionality
- No impact on user review submission
- No changes to review display logic
- Existing admin approval/rejection still works
