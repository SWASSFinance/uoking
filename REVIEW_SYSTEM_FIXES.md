# Review System Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Profile Image and Character Name Missing
**Problem**: Reviews were not displaying user profile images or character names, only showing the username.

**Root Cause**: The `getProductReviews` function in `/lib/db.ts` was only selecting basic user fields (`username`, `first_name`, `last_name`) but not including:
- `character_names` from the users table
- `profile_image_url` from the user_profiles table

### 2. Admin Approval Error
**Problem**: When approving reviews in the admin panel, an error was thrown even though the approval actually worked.

**Root Cause**: The admin approval API was trying to update `review_count` and `rating_count` columns in the users table, but these columns might not exist in all database schemas, causing the query to fail.

### 3. Review Association Issue
**Problem**: User reviews were not properly associated with user profiles in the account page.

**Root Cause**: The `getUserReviews` function was missing user information and the user reviews API had an import issue.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Review Display (`/lib/db.ts`)

**Updated `getProductReviews` function**:
```sql
SELECT 
  pr.*,
  u.username,
  u.first_name,
  u.last_name,
  u.character_names,           -- Added
  up.profile_image_url         -- Added
FROM product_reviews pr
JOIN users u ON pr.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON u.id = up.user_id  -- Added join
WHERE pr.product_id = $1 AND pr.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY pr.created_at DESC
```

**Updated `getUserReviews` function**:
```sql
SELECT 
  pr.*,
  p.name as product_name,
  p.slug as product_slug,
  p.image_url as product_image,
  u.username,                  -- Added
  u.first_name,                -- Added
  u.last_name,                 -- Added
  u.character_names            -- Added
FROM product_reviews pr
JOIN products p ON pr.product_id = p.id
JOIN users u ON pr.user_id = u.id  -- Added join
WHERE pr.user_id = $1
ORDER BY pr.created_at DESC
```

### 2. Fixed Admin Approval (`/app/api/admin/reviews/[id]/route.ts`)

**Added error handling for missing columns**:
```javascript
try {
  // Try to update user's review count (columns might not exist in all schemas)
  await query(`
    UPDATE users 
    SET review_count = COALESCE(review_count, 0) + 1,
        rating_count = COALESCE(rating_count, 0) + CASE WHEN $1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    WHERE id = $2
  `, [review.rating, review.user_id])
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Could not update user review counts (columns may not exist):', error)
  // Continue without failing the approval
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Review Component (`/components/product-reviews.tsx`)

**Updated Review interface**:
```typescript
interface Review {
  id: string
  rating: number
  title?: string
  content: string
  username: string
  first_name?: string        // Added
  last_name?: string         // Added
  character_names?: string[] // Added
  profile_image_url?: string // Added
  verified_purchase?: boolean
  created_at: string
}
```

**Enhanced review display**:
- Added profile image display with fallback to username initial
- Shows character name as primary display name
- Shows username in parentheses if character name exists
- Improved layout with proper spacing

### 4. Fixed User Reviews API (`/app/api/user/reviews/route.ts`)

**Fixed import issue**:
```javascript
// Before: const { query } = require('@/lib/db')
// After: import { getUserReviews, query } from '@/lib/db'
```

## How the Fixes Work

### Profile Image and Character Name Display
1. **Database Query**: Now fetches `character_names` and `profile_image_url`
2. **Component Logic**: 
   - Shows character name as primary name if available
   - Shows username in parentheses as secondary
   - Displays profile image with fallback to username initial
3. **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles missing data

### Admin Approval Error Prevention
1. **Error Handling**: Wraps user count updates in try-catch
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues approval even if count update fails
3. **Logging**: Warns about missing columns without breaking functionality

### Review Association
1. **Enhanced Queries**: Include all necessary user information
2. **Proper Joins**: Ensure all related data is fetched
3. **Fixed Imports**: Resolve module import issues

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `test-review-system.js` that verifies:

1. **Database Schema**: Checks for required tables and columns
2. **Review Data**: Examines existing reviews and their associated data
3. **User Statistics**: Validates review counts and user associations
4. **Data Integrity**: Identifies orphaned reviews or missing relationships

Run the test with:
```bash
node test-review-system.js
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Reviews will display**:
   - User's profile image (or username initial as fallback)
   - Character name as primary display name
   - Username in parentheses if character name exists
   - All review content and ratings

2. **Admin approval will**:
   - Work without throwing errors
   - Successfully update review status
   - Update user counts when possible
   - Continue working even if count columns don't exist

3. **User account page will**:
   - Show all user reviews properly
   - Display correct review counts
   - Include all review details and product information

## Backward Compatibility

All fixes are backward compatible:
- Existing reviews continue to work
- Missing data is handled gracefully with fallbacks
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Admin approval continues to work even with missing columns

## Future Considerations

1. **Database Migration**: Consider adding missing columns to users table if they don't exist
2. **Profile Images**: Implement proper image upload and storage for user profiles
3. **Character Names**: Add UI for users to manage their character names
4. **Review Verification**: Implement verified purchase badges based on order history
