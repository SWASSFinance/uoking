# Discord Integration

This document explains the Discord integration features in the UOKing platform.

## Features

### 1. Discord OAuth Authentication
- Users can sign up/login using their Discord account
- Discord username and ID are automatically stored
- Profile image from Discord is synced

### 2. Discord Account Linking
- Users who registered with email/Google can link their Discord account
- Links Discord username, ID, and profile image
- Prevents duplicate Discord accounts

### 3. Profile Enhancement
- Shows Discord connection status in user profile
- Displays Discord username when connected
- Option to link Discord account if not connected

## How It Works

### Discord OAuth Sign Up/Login
1. User clicks "Sign in with Discord"
2. Discord OAuth flow handles authentication
3. System stores:
   - Discord username (`discord_username`)
   - Discord ID (`discord_id`) 
   - Profile image URL
4. User is logged in and redirected

### Discord Account Linking
1. User goes to Account ‚Üí Profile page
2. If Discord not connected, shows "Link Discord" button
3. Clicking button redirects to Discord OAuth
4. After OAuth, Discord info is linked to existing account
5. Profile image and username are updated

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table has these Discord fields:
discord_username VARCHAR(50)  -- Discord username (e.g., "john_doe")
discord_id VARCHAR(50)        -- Discord user ID (e.g., "123456789012345678")
```

## User Experience

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created

   - Adds `discord_id` column to users table
   - Creates index for performance

2. **NextAuth Configuration** (`app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
   - Stores Discord ID and username during OAuth
   - Updates existing users when they sign in with Discord
   - Includes Discord info in session

3. **Type Definitions** (`types/next-auth.d.ts`)
   - Adds Discord fields to session and user types

4. **Account Page** (`app/account/page.tsx`)
   - Shows Discord connection status
   - Provides Discord linking functionality
   - Displays Discord username when connected

5. **API Endpoint** (`app/api/user/link-discord/route.ts`)
   - Handles Discord account linking
   - Prevents duplicate Discord accounts
   - Updates profile image

```typescript
const discordUsername = session?.user?.discordUsername;
const discordId = session?.user?.discordId;
```
