 Personally when i started playing Ultima Online i had a Red Cu Sidhe. I enjoyed having this pet because I was able to ride the pet along with kill various monsters. The pet was also able to heal itself, the only other pet side from the Cu Sidhe that could heals itself is the Triton. The fact this pet could heal itself was very convenient when killing a bunch of monsters.  In order to bond the pet to yourself you need to feed the pet everyday for seven days or you can use a pet bonding potion which will bond the pet to yourself instantly. The reason you want to bond your pet is so when the pet dies you can resurrect the pet. If you do not bond your pet once it dies it will be gone forever. ",,"pets.png"
