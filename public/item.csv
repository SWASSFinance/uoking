As a veteran reward, it provides a secure and convenient method for selling items to other players. The process involves placing the desired item into the safe, setting auction parameters such as minimum bid and duration, and then letting other players place bids. This system not only enables players to showcase their items but also facilitates higher sales than traditional vendor methods. The Auction Safe is a valuable tool for entrepreneurial players who want to run their own in-game auctions and manage sales efficiently.

The Auction Safe in Ultima Online is a valuable item for players who want to conduct auctions within their homes. Introduced as a veteran reward, it allows players to place items up for auction, displaying them prominently for other players to bid on. To set up an auction, the player selects an item from their backpack, ensuring it meets specific criteria, such as not being a container or exceeding a certain weight. The auction setup includes defining a starting bid and auction duration, and optionally a ""Buy Now"" price. Once the auction begins, it cannot be altered. Bidders must have sufficient funds in their accounts, which are deducted if their bid is the highest. Upon the auction's conclusion, the winning bidder has three days to claim the item, after which it reverts to the owner if unclaimedâ€‹

The Auction Safe enhances player interaction and commerce, allowing for competitive bidding and immediate notification of auction outcomes via in-game mail. The owner of the Auction Safe receives the payment immediately upon auction completion, and the safe can be reused for future auctions. The auction system ensures transparency and efficiency, as bidders receive notifications if they are outbid and get refunds if their bids are not successful. This functionality makes the Auction Safe a must-have for any Ultima Online entrepreneur looking to maximize their sales and create dynamic trading opportunities within the game","1st Year Veteran Reward","auctionsafe.png","auctionsafe.png","10.99","26","0","0",,"0",,"0","1",,,"0","0","2018-09-10"

"460","Ankh of Sacrifice","The Ankh of Sacrifice in Ultima Online is a special veteran reward item that allows players to self-resurrect. Unlike standard decorative ankhs, this functional item can be used by both blue and red players to resurrect themselves within their house or any accessible house, as long as they are within range. It has a cooldown period of one hour between uses. This feature makes it particularly valuable for players who often find themselves in perilous situations, providing a quick way to return to life without seeking external help. The Ankh of Sacrifice comes in a deed form and can be placed facing either south or east, adding a practical and aesthetic element to player homes.

The Ankh of Sacrifice in Ultima Online is a coveted item available as a 10th-year veteran reward. This special item, presented in deed form, allows players to place an Ankh in their home. Unlike the purely decorative Ankhs available at earlier veteran reward tiers, the Ankh of Sacrifice has a significant functional benefit: it enables any player, regardless of their character's moral alignment (blue or red) or account age, to self-resurrect once an hour within the house where the Ankh is placed. This makes it an invaluable asset for players engaged in high-risk activities who need a reliable method to revive without depending on other players.

To use the Ankh of Sacrifice, a player simply double-clicks the deed and selects the desired facing direction before targeting the placement spot. The Ankh can be re-deeded using an axe, allowing for flexibility in its positioning. Additionally, it can lock a character's Karma, a unique feature among Ankhs. However, it cannot be used for tithing with the Chivalry skill and is not dyeable with a Furniture Dye Tub. The ability to self-resurrect is especially useful in PvP scenarios or dangerous PvE encounters, providing a strategic advantage by minimizing downtime after death.","10th Year Veteran Reward","anhkofsacrifice.png","anhkofsacrifice.png","29.99","26","0","0",,"0",,"0","1",,,"0","0","2019-11-18"

"813","Yukio's Glass Earrings","Yukio's Glass Earrings in Ultima Online are a valuable item introduced during the ""Soulless Seduction"" event in Publish 110. These earrings are highly sought after due to their unique attributes, making them a versatile choice for various character builds. They provide a significant boost to Luck, adding 125 points, which enhances the chances of better loot drops from monsters. Additionally, they increase Spell Damage by 15%, which is particularly beneficial for mages, as there is no cap on Spell Damage Increase (SDI) in Player vs. Monster (PvM) scenarios. The earrings are durable, with a maximum durability of 255, but they cannot be repaired using Powder of Fortification, meaning their longevity is limited over time.  
This is a rare drop in a new quest chain released in Ultima Online. Yukio's glass earrings are popular in UO, because of the new 125 luck stat that was never before available in this slot.

"822","Balron Bone Armor","The Balron Bone Armor in Ultima Online is a highly coveted piece of equipment known for its unique combination of properties that make it particularly beneficial for certain character builds. This armor is a part of the bone armor set and provides a mix of health, stamina, and lower mana cost bonuses that are difficult to find in modern Legendary artifacts. Specifically, it offers a significant advantage to dexxers (melee fighters) who benefit from these stats. Players value this piece for its balance of high-intensity mods and decent resistances, making it a top choice for those looking to maximize their character's effectiveness in combat.

Additionally, the Balron Bone Armor can be enhanced, though this requires a high level of tailoring skill and the appropriate materials. Enhancing the armor can further improve its properties, though the process can be tricky and is not always successful. Some players have noted the armor's potential to be dyed and customized, adding to its appeal. Given its robust properties and versatility, the Balron Bone Armor is considered a best-in-slot item for many players, particularly those focused on achieving optimal performance without the excessive costs associated with other high-end equipment options

The is the best stat based chest piece for a sampire/dexer/warrior/dragoon class. The balron bone armor is shard bound from a limited time event which means we may only be able to deliver this item on Atlantic shard and no others.

Additionally, the Autoloom can be customized with various dyes, including regular, furniture, pigment, and promotional dyes, making it both functional and aesthetically versatile.

As a valued item among veteran players, the Autoloom not only enhances efficiency in resource processing but also adds a decorative element to player homes. This item reflects the game's dedication to rewarding long-term players with useful and unique tools.

This unique item provides a protective buff that lasts for two hours, during which any items on the player's corpse are safe from being pilfered by monsters. However, the chalice can only be used once every 24 hours, which means players need to strategically decide when to activate its protection. This feature makes it especially useful for players who often engage in prolonged battles or explore dangerous areas where death and subsequent looting are common risks.

Originally introduced as part of a broader update, the Chalice of Pilfering Protection replaced the older Monster-Proof Chest. This item was particularly well-received because it addressed longstanding player concerns about the inconvenience and frustration caused by monster looting. While the chalice offers significant relief, its limited activation period means that it doesn't completely eliminate the risk, requiring players to continue to manage their in-game activities and risks carefully. Despite its limitations, the chalice remains a highly sought-after item for enhancing the gameplay experience by providing a layer of security for valuable possessions during high-stakes adventures.",,"chalice-of-pilfering-protection.png","chalice-of-pilfering-protection.png","74.99","26","0","0",,"0",,"0","0",NULL,,"0","0","2023-01-17"

"1089","BG's Fishing Pole","BG's Fishing Pole in Ultima Online is a veteran reward item introduced as part of the game's efforts to reward long-time players. This special fishing pole is designed to enhance the fishing experience by preventing the fisherman from catching any unwanted footwear, which is a common nuisance in the game's fishing mechanics. The pole is blessed, ensuring it cannot be lost upon death, and it possesses the Spell Channeling property, allowing spellcasting without unequipping it. As a two-year veteran reward, it is part of a series of incentives aimed at acknowledging and rewarding players' loyalty to the game.

Despite its intended benefits, BG's Fishing Pole has received mixed feedback from the community. Some players appreciate the functional advantage it offers by reducing the clutter of fishing up useless items. However, others feel that it falls short of its potential, suggesting that it could have included additional features or been part of a more significant quest reward. The item embodies the balance between offering a useful tool and maintaining the spirit of a veteran reward as a token of appreciation rather than a game-changing necessityâ€‹",,,NULL,"47.99","26","0","0",,"0",,"0","0",NULL,,"0","0","2024-05-11"

The carapace itself is the hardened exoskeleton of powerful arachnids, believed to contain residual traces of their lethal potency, which skilled artisans can harness through magical refinement.  This prized resource is most commonly acquired from formidable Trapdoor Spiders and the fearsome Navrey Night-Eyes, both of which lurk in the depths of Britannia's most treacherous caverns. Warriors and treasure hunters often seek out these creatures, not only for the challenge they present but also for the lucrative rewards they yield.

"1192","Common Gems x 20k","Common gems like citrine, diamonds, and others play a crucial role in the crafting and imbuing processes. These gems are not only valuable as tradable commodities but are essential ingredients in creating powerful equipment. During the imbuing process, gems are used to infuse items with magical properties, enhancing weapons, armor, and jewelry with bonuses like increased damage, resistance, or skill enhancements. Each type of gem is associated with specific attributes, making them key components for imbuers who wish to customize and optimize their gear. Citrine, for instance, is often linked to specific magical properties, while diamonds are used in enhancing resilience or strength. This gem-based system allows players to tailor their equipment to personal needs or playstyles, adding a layer of strategy and depth to the crafting mechanics of the game.

saving time by purchasing a bundle pack of 20,000 of each type of gem, rather than buying them individually from an NPC vendor, is a massive convenience for crafters and imbuers. Buying gems one by one from vendors can be slow and tedious, especially when crafting high-end gear requires large quantities of different gems. A bundle purchase eliminates the need for constant trips back to vendors and the hassle of restocking, allowing players to focus more on crafting and imbuing without interruption. This not only streamlines the process but also saves valuable in-game time, enabling players to craft and enhance items more efficiently, maximize productivity, and keep pace with the demands of their gameplay
